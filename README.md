# 📘 ML Phishing Email Classification – Learning Project

This repository contains a **learning-focused machine learning project**
exploring how **text classification techniques** can be applied to
a basic cybersecurity problem: **phishing email detection**.

This project was built as part of my journey in learning:
- Machine Learning fundamentals
- NLP preprocessing
- Supervised classification
- ML application in cybersecurity

⚠️ This is **not a production-ready system** and is intended purely
for **educational and experimentation purposes**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand text preprocessing using NLTK
- Learn TF-IDF vectorization
- Train and evaluate a Naive Bayes classifier
- Interpret precision, recall, and F1-score
- Connect ML concepts with cybersecurity use cases

## 🧪 What This Project Does
- Takes raw email text as input
- Cleans and vectorizes text using TF-IDF
- Trains a Naive Bayes model to classify emails as:
  - Safe Email
  - Phishing Email
- Provides a simple Flask-based interface for experimentation

## 📊 Experiment Results
- Accuracy: ~94.5%
- Phishing recall: ~94%

These results are **dataset-dependent** and shown only to
demonstrate learning outcomes.
